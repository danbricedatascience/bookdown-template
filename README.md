# Bookdown template

This is a bookdown template especially built to get better LaTeX Books.

* Start parts and chapters on any page, so avoid getting blank page before next chapter _As now most of the PDF are not published in paperback format_
* [htbp] Figures positions _standard figures from R chuncks does not provide it_
* Hyperlink and Table of Content colors

If the book needs to be published in paperback format, simply remove `classoption: oneside` in YAML part of `index.Rmd`

[Bookdown](https://bookdown.org) is a an open-source (GPL-3) R package to facilitate writing books and long-form articles/reports with R Markdown.
